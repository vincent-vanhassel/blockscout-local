# npm resolution error report

While resolving: black-dashboard-react@1.2.2
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0" from react-chartjs-2@3.3.0
node_modules/react-chartjs-2
  react-chartjs-2@"3.3.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
